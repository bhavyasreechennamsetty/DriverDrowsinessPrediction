This project uses a machine learning approach to predict driver drowsiness based on eye state classification. It is not a real-time system but focuses on accurate offline prediction.

Dataset: Yawn and Eye Dataset (Kaggle) "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/serenaraju/yawn-eye-dataset-new"

Tech Stack: Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras

Approach:

Preprocessed eye and yawn images to build a binary classification model.

Trained a CNN to distinguish between 'Open', 'Closed', and 'Yawning' states.

Combined classifications to assess drowsiness risk.

Goal: To demonstrate how computer vision and deep learning can be used to predict drowsiness from images, with potential applications in transportation safety systems.
